# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

This project demonstrates **Customer Segmentation** using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis. The Python notebook provides a practical implementation of RFM to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

## Project Overview

RFM Analysis is a powerful method for analyzing customer value by looking at three key factors:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often they make purchases.
- **Monetary**: How much they spend.

This analysis helps businesses categorize customers into different segments for targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## Notebook Features

The following sections are covered in the notebook:

1. **Declaring Python Libraries and Loading Data File**:
   - Import required libraries.
   - Load the dataset into a Python environment.

2. **Geographical Segmentation**:
   - Analyze customer distribution across geographical regions.
   - List customers by their corresponding regions.

3. **Behavioral Segmentation**:
   - Segment customers based on behavioral aspects derived from the dataset.

4. **Creating RFM Scores**:
   - Generate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer.
   - Combine these scores to compute the overall RFM score for segmentation.

5. **Customer RFM Segmentation**:
   - Use RFM scores to categorize customers into meaningful segments.
   - Output results for analysis.
